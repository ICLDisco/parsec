All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to the Developer
Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1. This is exactly the same one created
and used by the Linux kernel developers and posted on
http://developercertificate.org/. This is a developer's certification that he
or she has the right to submit the patch for inclusion into the project. Simply
submitting a contribution implies this agreement, however, please include a
"Signed-off-by" tag in every patch (this tag is a conventional way to confirm
that you agree to the DCO).
