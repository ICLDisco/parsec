/**
 * This is a simple example on how to use the parsec profiling system standalone
 *
 * Compilation:
 *  Include dirs must point to a directory with profiling.h (in parsec/ directory)
 *    (NB profiling.h is standalone, you can also copy it where you need it)
 *  The program must be linked with libparsec.a and libparsec-base.a
 *  The libraries must be compiled with PARSEC_PROF_TRACE enabled
 *
 * Execution:
 *  Just execute the binary without arguments. This produces a sp-0.prof-* file
 *  that holds the trace example
 *
 * Explanation of the code:
 *  This code uses NB_THREADS that each produce EVENTS_PER_THREAD event pairs
 *  Each event pair is either of type A or B
 *  Events of type A have no information structure
 *  Events of type B have an information structure with an int (i), and a double (d)
 *  Events are correctly paired (no overlapping of events inside the same thread), but
 *    this is not required by the profiling system if events are correctly identified.
