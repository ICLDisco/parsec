/**
 * kcyclic _view_ of the 2-D Block cyclic distributed matrix. The goal is to
 * improve access locality by changing access order without incurring the cost of a physical
 * redistribution of the dataset. The underlying data storage is unchanged,
 * but the view provide accessors that swap lines and column blocks so that a block
 * from the same processor is provided for @kp repetitions along the m direction
 * (@kq along n, respectively); until such repetition is not possible anymore
 * (right edge, or bottom of the matrix where not enough local tiles are available).
 *
 * For example, starting from a standard 2D grid PxQ=2x2 with kp=2;
 * and m/mb = 6;
 *   rank_of(0,0) is 0; data_of(0,0) is origin (0,0)
 *   rank_of(1,0) is 0 (because kp=2); data_of(1,0) is origin (2,0)
 *   rank_of(2,0) is 1; data_of(2,0) is origin (1,0)
 *   rank_of(3,0) is 1 (because kp=2); data_of(3,0) is origin (3,0)
 *   rank_of(4,0) is 0; data_of(4,0) is origin (4,0)
 *   rank_of(5,0) is 1; data_of(5,0) is origin (5,0): despite kp=2,
 *     there are not enough local tiles on rank 0 to satisfy the view
 *     origin (6,0) does not exist), hence the view provides the next
 *     block on the m direction.
 *
 * Beware that using a kcyclic view is equivalent to swapping rows (or
 * columns, respectively), and the algorithm operating on the data may have
 * special requirements for it to be applicable. For example, a kcyclic
 * view of a diagonal dominant matrix is not always diagonal dominant; and the
 * result of a factorization on a kcyclic view is not a 'triangular' matrix,
 * but a swap, according to the view (i.e., solving the system requires applying
 * a compatible view on the right-hand side as well).
