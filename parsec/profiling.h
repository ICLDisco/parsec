/**
 * @defgroup parsec_public_profiling Tracing System
 * @ingroup parsec_public
 * @{
 *
 * @brief The PaRSEC profiling system allows to expose information
 *   about the DAG and the runtime engine for analysis.
 * @details
 *    The profiling system is designed to be used standalone when practical.
 *    See [sp-demo.c](@ref tests/standalone-profiling/sp-demo.c) as a standalone
 *    example with complete usage of the profiling API.
 *
 * @remark Note about thread safety:
 *    Some functions are thread safe, others are not.
 *    The tracing function itself  is not thread-safe: this is addressed here
 *    by providing a thread-specific context for the only operation
 *    that should happen in parallel.
 *
 * # Concepts
 * The profiling system saves information about the execution into a binary
 * profile file that can then be converted into a HDF5 Pandas dataframe
 * using the profiling python tools available in the tools/profiling/python
 * directory.
 *
 * One file per rank is created, and the profiling python tools will merge
 * these files, and make the format portable between architecture. The rationale
 * behind this two-steps approach is to do minimum processing during the
 * execution to avoid modifying it significantly. All logging happens
 * in memory until exhaustion of the buffers.
 *
 * ## Events
 * Events are timed entities that go in pairs. The main purpose of the profiling
 * system is to log information about timing of events that happen on different
 * threads. Events have a dictionary key (which defines if the event starts or
 * end a pair), a time (determined internally), a thread (on which they happen),
 * and potentially an information structure (that logs complementary information
 * related to the start or end of the event).
 *
 * ## Event keys
 * Event keys are created in a dictionary that is global and must be consistent
 * between ranks. They come with a human readable name, an RGB color
 * specification, and an information convertor and size.
 *
 * ## Information
 * Arbitrary information can be logged with each event. To do so, when registering
 * the event type, the user must specify how many bytes are passed to the information
 * of the event type, and how to convert these bytes into meaningful fields.
 * Conversion happens offline, at binary profile processing time.
 *
 * The conversion string is a series of "name{type}" separated by ';'. The type
 * must be a base type from stdint (e.g. int64_t). The name is the field name used.
 * The user must take into account padding explicitly.
 * For example, if structures like
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * struct { char a; char b; int c; };
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * is passed as information, the structure would be 8 bytes long, and a possible
 * converting string would be "a{int8_t};b{int8_t};padding{int16_t};c{int32_t}"
 *
 * ## Key/Values pairs
 * In addition to events, the profiling system can log arbitrary character
 * strings in the form of key/value pairs that relate to the execution.
 *
 * These key/value pairs can be saved globally for the process, or per profiling
 * stream.
 *
 * Note that on success, most of these functions return 0, NOT PARSEC_SUCCESS.
 * PARSEC_SUCCESS may be lower than 0 (0 >= PARSEC_SUCCESS > error codes).
 * This is done so that this file can be used without including
 * parsec/constants.h.
