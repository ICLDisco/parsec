 * duplicates, entries in the \em major array are favored over
 * those in the \em minor array.
 *
 * Both \em major and \em minor are expected to be argv-style
 * arrays (i.e., terminated with a NULL pointer).
 *
 * The array that is returned is an unencumbered array that should
 * later be freed with a call to parsec_argv_free().
 *
 * Either (or both) of \em major and \em minor can be NULL.  If
 * one of the two is NULL, the other list is simply copied to the
 * output.  If both are NULL, NULL is returned.

 * Portable version of setenv(3), allowing editing of any

 *
 * @param name String name of the environment variable to look for
 * @param value String value to set (may be NULL)
 * @param overwrite Whether to overwrite any existing value with
 * the same name
 * @param env The environment to use
 *
 * @retval OPAL_ERR_OUT_OF_RESOURCE If internal malloc() fails.
 * @retval OPAL_EXISTS If the name already exists in \em env and
 * \em overwrite is false (and therefore the \em value was not
 * saved in \em env)
 * @retval OPAL_SUCESS If the value replaced another value or is
 * appended to \em env.
 *
 * \em env is expected to be a NULL-terminated array of pointers
 * (argv-style).  Note that unlike some implementations of
 * putenv(3), if \em value is insertted in \em env, it is copied.
 * So the caller can modify/free both \em name and \em value after
 * parsec_setenv() returns.
 *
 * The \em env array will be grown if necessary.
 *
 * It is permissable to invoke this function with the
 * system-defined \em environ variable.  For example:
 *
 * \code
 *   #include "opal/util/parsec_environ.h"
 *   parsec_setenv("foo", "bar", true, &environ);
 * \endcode
 *
 * NOTE: If you use the real environ, parsec_setenv() will turn
 * around and perform putenv() to put the value in the
 * environment.  This may very well lead to a memory leak, so its
 * use is strongly discouraged.
 *
 * It is also permissable to call this function with an empty \em
 * env, as long as it is pre-initialized with NULL:
 *
 * \code
 *   char **my_env = NULL;
 *   parsec_setenv("foo", "bar", true, &my_env);
 * \endcode
