This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PaRSEC since v1.1.0

 - Add a MCA parameter to control the number of ejeted blocks from GPU
   memory (device_cuda max_number_of_ejected_data).

 - Reshape the users vision of PaRSEC: they only have to include a single
   header (parsec.h) for most usages, and link with a single library
   (-lparsec).

 - Update the PaRSEC DSL handling of initial tasks. We now rely on 2
   pieces of information: the number of DSL tasks, and the number of
   tasks imposed by the system (all types of data transfer).

 - Add a purely local scheduler (ll), that uses a single LIFO per
   thread. Each schedule operation does 1 atomic (push in local queue),
   each select operation does up to t atomics (pop in local queue, then
   try any other thread's queue until they are all tested empty).

 - Add a --ignore-properties=... option to parsec_ptgpp

 - Change API of hash tables: allow keys of arbitrary size. The API
   features how to build a key from a task; how to hash a key into
   1 <= N <= 64 bits; and how to compare twy keys (plus a printing
   function to debug).

 - Change behavior of DEBUG_HISTORY: log all information inside
   a buffer of fixed size (MCA parameter) per thread, do not allocate
   memory during logging, and use timestamp to re-order output
   when the user calls dump()

 - DTD interface is updated (new flag to send pointer as parameter,
   unpacking of paramteres is simpler etc).

 - DTD provides mca param (dtd_debug_verbose) to print information
   about traversal of DAG in a separate output stream from the default.

v 2.0.0rc2
 - Rename all functions, files, directories from dague/DAGUE/DAGuE to
   parsec/PARSEC/PaRSEC.

v 2.0.0rc1
 - .so support. Dynamic Library Build has been succesfully tested on
   Linux platforms, reducing significantly the size of the compiled
   dplasma/testing directory. Note that on modern architectures,
   all depending libraries must be compiled either as Position Independent
   Code (-fPIC) or as shared libraries. Hint: add --cflags="-fPIC" when
   running the plasma-installer.
 - The "inline_c %{ ... %}" block syntax has been simplified to either
   "%c{ ... %}" or "%{ ... %}". The change is backward compatible.

v 1.2.0
 - The support for C is required from MPI.
 - Revert to an older LEX syntax (not (?i:xxx))
 - Don't recursively call the MPI communication engine progress function.
 - Protect the runtime headers from inclusion in C++ files.
 - Fix a memory leak allowing the remote data to be released once used.
 - Integrate the new profiling system and the python interface (added
   Panda support).
 - Change several default parameters for the DPLASMA tests.
 - Add Fortran support for the PaRSEC and the profiling API and add tests
   to validate it.
 - Backport all the profiling features from the devel branch (panda support,
   simpler management, better integration with python, support for HDF5...).
 - Change the colorscheme of the .dot generator
 - Correctly compute the identifier of the tasks (ticket #33).
 - Allocate the list items from the corresponding list using the requested
   gap.
 - Add support for older lex (without support for ?i).
 - Add support for 128 bits atomics and resolve the lingering ABA issue.
   When 128 bits atomics are not available fall back to an atomic lock
   implementation of the most basic data structures.
 - Required Cython 0.19.1 (at least)
 - Completely disconnect the ordering of parameters and locals in the JDF.
 - Many other minor bug fixes, code readability impeovement and typos.
 - DPLASMA:
   - Add the doxygen documentation generation.
   - Improved ztrmm with all the matrix reads unified.
   - Support for potri functions (trtri+lauum), and corresponding testings.
   - Fix bug in symmetric/hermitian norms when A.mt < P.
