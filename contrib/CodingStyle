# PaRSEC coding style

## Indentation

The Linux coding style, despite the fact that it declare
the indentation equal to 8 chars, is a perfectly logical
coding style. Read more at
http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

Here is the list of exception that applies on this project:
- indentation is 4 chars
- tabs are not allowed

## Debugs

The runtime should never use printf directly. All debug messages
should flow through the functions defined in `dague/debug.h`.

`DAGUE_DEBUG` is defined as soon as the build type is "Debug"
(as inferred from CMake).

`NDEBUG` controls the compilation of `assert` statements, and
is defined by default in the "Release" build type.

`DAGUE_DEBUG_NOISIER` compiles in all debug output using one
of the all uppercase output functions (i.e. `DAGUE_DEBUG_VERBOSE,
DAGUE_OUTPUT, etc.) By default all uppercase output functions
are stripped from the compilation. Lowercase ouput functions
(i.e. `dague_debug_verbose` are always compiled in (including
in "Release" build type!)

`DAGUE_DEBUG_HISTORY` compiles in a lightweight debugging
circular buffer. All debug output are copied to this circular
buffer. Additional entries can be added to the circular buffer
with the `dague_debug_history_add` function (usage seen in
`debug_marks.c`). The content of the debug history buffer can
be printed with `dague_debug_history_dump` (including from
`gdb`).

### Printing information relevant to the type of users

The runtime should never use `assert` to check for wrong input
parameters from the user. It is ok to end the program with
`assert` when checking for bugs.

The 3 functions `dague_abort`, `dague_warning` and `dague_info`
print messages to the default runtime output stream.
- `dague_abort`: when a runtime condition happens and the program
  needs to stop with an error.
- `dague_warning`: when an anomalous runtime condition needs
  to be reported (user requested hardware not available, for
  example), but the program can continue.
- `dague_info`: when important (but not anomalous) information
  needs to be reported to the user (as an example, when reporting
  process placement, type of hardware, etc.)

`dague_debug_verbose` can output to a stream with a verbosity
parameter. All messages with a verbosity of 3,4 are considered to
be targetting end-users. Higher verbosity levels are targetting
develloppers.

### Per-topic output streams

The output stream `dague_debug_output` is always available to
print debug messages. If you are devellopping a particular
component/topic, you can serapate the outputs of this topic
by creating your own output stream. That output stream can then
be sent to a segregated output file, or have a different
verbosity than the rest of the debugging framework.

By default, you should use the `dague_debug_output`, except if
requested by mca parameters (mycomponent_verbose==-1: use the
default; mycomponent_verbose>=0: create an output stream with
given verbosity). An example can be seen in
`dague/devices/cuda/dev_cuda.c`

### Verbosity guidelines

The runtime parameter `debug_verbose` controls the maximum
verbosity allowed to be printed out on the `dague_debug_output`
stream. The following guidelines are given to users, and all
components should abide by them, in all debug output streams:
0. Errors only
1. Warnings
2. Info (default)
3-4. User Debug (i.e. process mapping details, loaded
     components, etc.)
5-9. Devel Debug (i.e. once per task action)
>=10. Chatterbox Debug (i.e. breakdown of the steps of an
     action, actions that happen in loops, etc.)

In addition, things like memory allocations, freelist status, etc.
should use a level >=20.
